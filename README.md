Hi! I'm a developer working fullstack + interested in security.
Make sure you visit my blogs and profile!

# Current interest
- Fullstack development and open source, for sure! Some projects I've been working on: 
  - [UI Theory](https://github.com/9oelM/ui-theory): UI = f(state). React made out of vanilla javascript.
  - [Youtube Lite](https://github.com/9oelM/youtube-lite): No more wasting time on watching random, irrelevant videos on Youtube.
  - [elasticpwn](https://github.com/9oelM/elasticpwn): Quickly collect data from thousands of exposed Elasticsearch or Kibana instances and generate a report to be reviewed.
  - [atm](https://github.com/9oelM/atm): a set of AuToMation scripts for hacking.
- My current interest also lies in **ethical hacking** (I'm still learning and need to grow a lot). 
  - In my free time, I would go [find security vulnerabilities and report them](https://hackerone.com/9oelm).
  - [Find me here too](https://bugbounty.naver.com/ko/halloffame)
  - [And here too](https://bugbounty.whale.naver.com/en/halloffame)

# Speciality
- I'm really good at React, Node.js and Typescript and have vast understanding of javascript ecosystem itself + quite a good grasp of cloud infra. You should really go read the articles I wrote on my blog. Many people seem to read and like it. For example, [this one](https://medium.com/swlh/making-stupid-react-smart-in-re-rendering-5f04b5bab327).
- I'm a firm believer in the future of [wasm](https://webassembly.org/). I'm always interested in wasm and better than an average person at it.
