- Hobby: computer security (I'm still learning and need to grow a lot): 
  - In my free time, I would go [find security vulnerabilities and report them](https://hackerone.com/9oelm).
  - [Find me here too](https://bugbounty.naver.com/ko/halloffame)

# Specialty
- I'm really good at React, Node.js and Typescript. Also cloud infra and automation. You should really go read the articles I wrote on my blog. Many people seem to read and like it. For example, [this one](https://medium.com/swlh/making-stupid-react-smart-in-re-rendering-5f04b5bab327).
- I'm a firm believer in the future of [wasm](https://webassembly.org/). I'm always interested in wasm and better than an average person at it.
